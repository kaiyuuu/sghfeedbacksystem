# Feedbacksystem
# IS4250 Group Project

## Description
This is a closed loop feedback system that enables staff to submit and track the outcome of their feedback. The system also allows Process Owners (POs) to handle and respond to incoming feedback and forward any feedback that was sent to the wrong category. This entire process is overseen by the admin who has a complete overview of the entire system. The goal of the system is to have an intuitive and minimalist design so that any stakeholder who uses the system can easily navigate and perform the task they require easily. Some of the key features of the system have been highlighted below.

## Key Features
### 1) Feedback Submission
A staff member will start with the feedback submission when they have feedback. If they are unsure of which subcategory their feedback falls under, our team has created a table with the list of categories and their subcategories. This aims to provide a succinct description of each of the subcategories so it may reduce the error rate of staff submitting their feedback to the wrong department.

### 2) Admin Supervision
The admin portal allows a view of all feedback table within the system enables them to have oversight over the entire closed loop feedback system. This allows the admin to ensure that the system is operating ideally without any abuse from staff. Admin will also be able to facilitate the processing and completion rate of feedback. This allows them to hold the respective PO accountable if necessary. Overall, this enforces accountability for the system so that all feedback would ideally be resolved eventually.

### 3) Analytics
POs also have access to analytics relevant to their subcategories on their homepage to identify relevant information regarding the feedback they have received (Appendix D). They can customise the analytics by date range and even download the analytics. This can be useful for reports or sharing of information.
